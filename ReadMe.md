## Live CPU and RAM Usage Monitoring Web-App using Django and Python

**This is a project of a front-end (web-app) that monitors the CPU and RAM Utilization Metrics of a server in real-time.**

And it outputs the usage metrics in form of visualizations for better understanding and pattern/trend analysis. 

Adding to that, I have setup a system whenever the RAM Usage crosses 50% and is like that consecutive 10 seconds, a warning mail will be sent to the person who handles it using a third-party email client.

Since, programs/libraries can be OS specific, I have written the code in such a way, it will run on both Windows and Unix OS Supported Machines and Servers.

I have used python version 3.8 so, this project is version specific

***And this work is solely compiled&programmed by myself (Vinodh Kumar Adari) with some help of online resources and third-party libraries.***
